<h1>iPad Keyboard Weights</h1>
<p>Apple never includes weights for these things, so I'm trying to make a list. PRs welcome.</p>
<p>What's intentionally not included:</p>
<ul>
<li>anything that is not a case/cover</li>
<li>cases/covers that connect via Bluetooth and have to have an internal battery</li>
</ul>
<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Find someone, anyone who has weighed the Magic Keyboard Folio.</li>
<li>[ ] Add more stuff to the table.</li>
<li>[ ] Make the table sortable/filterable.</li>
<li>[ ] Display combined weights of each iPad and compatible keyboards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>

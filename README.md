# iPad Keyboard Weights

Apple never includes weights for these things, so I'm trying to make a list. PRs welcome.

What's intentionally not included:

- anything that is not a case/cover
- cases/covers that connect via Bluetooth and have to have an internal battery

## To Do

- [ ] Find someone, anyone who has weighed the Magic Keyboard Folio.
- [ ] Add more stuff to the table.
- [ ] Make the table sortable/filterable.
- [ ] Display combined weights of each iPad and compatible keyboards.

# iPad Keyboard Weights

Apple never includes weights for these things, so I'm trying to make a list. PRs welcome.

What's intentionally not included:

- anything that is not a case/cover
- cases/covers that connect via Bluetooth and have to have an internal battery

## To Do

- [ ] Add a way to display combined weights of iPads and compatible keyboards.
- [ ] [Make the table sortable/filterable](https://github.com/zachleat/filter-container).
- [ ] Find someone, anyone who has weighed the Magic Keyboard Folio.
